    <h1>TYPES OF DEPRESSION</h1>

        
        
<H3>MAJOR DEPRESSION</H3><P>Major depressive disorder, or major depression, is characterized by a combination of symptoms that interfere with a person's ability to work, sleep, study, eat, and enjoy once-pleasurable activities Episodes of depression often follow stressful events such as marital problems or the death of a loved one. The exact causes of depression still are not clear. What we do know is that both genetics and a stressful environment, or life situation, contribute to its cause or sudden onset.

Some of the signs and symptoms according to the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5, include the following: 
</P>
<h2> symptoms</h2>
<p>Prolonged sadness or unexplained crying spells
Significant changes in appetite and sleep patterns
Irritability, anger, worry, agitation, anxiety
Pessimism, indifference
Loss of energy, persistent lethargy
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness
Inability to concentrate, indecisiveness
Inability to take pleasure in former interests, social withdrawal
Unexplained aches and pains
Recurring thoughts of death or suicide</p>
        
<H3>SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER</H3>
<P>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes with the seasons, typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer. Depressive episodes linked to the summer can occur, but are much less common than winter episodes of SAD.
</P>
<H2>Symptoms </H2>
        <P>*Feeling depressed most of the day, nearly every day</p>
<p>*Feeling hopeless or worthless</p>
<p>*Having low energy</p>
<p>*Losing interest in activities you once enjoyed</p>
<p>*Having problems with sleep</p>
        <p>*Experiencing changes in your appetite or weight</p>
<p>*Feeling sluggish or agitated</p>
<p>*Having difficulty concentrating</p>
<p>*Having frequent thoughts of death or suicide.</p>
<h2>*Symptoms of the Winter Pattern of SAD include:</h2>

<p>*Having low energy</p>
<p>*Hypersomnia</p>
<p>*Overeating</p>
<p>*Weight gain</p>
<p>*Craving for carbohydrates</p>
<p>*Social withdrawal (feel like “hibernating”)</p>
        <h2>Symptoms of the less frequently occurring summer seasonal affective disorder include:</h2>

<p>Poor appetite with associated weight loss</p>
<p>Insomnia</p>
<p><p>Agitation</p>
<p>Restlessness</p>
<p>Anxiety</p>
<p>Episodes of violent behavior</p>

<H3> PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (DYSTHYMIA)</H3>
<p>Dysthymia is characterized by an overwhelming yet chronic state of depression, exhibited by a depressed mood for most of the days, for more days than not, for at least 2 years.  (In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at  least 1 year.)  The person who suffers from this disorder must not have gone for more than 2 months without experiencing two or more of the following symptoms.</p>
<P>If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions — you may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or incapable of having fun. Though persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.

Because of the chronic nature of persistent depressive disorder, coping with depression symptoms can be challenging, but a combination of talk therapy (psychotherapy) and medication can be effective in treating this condition.</P>

      <H2>Symptoms</H2>
       <P>Symptoms of persistent depressive disorder can cause significant impairment and may include:

    <P>*Loss of interest in daily activities</P>
    <P>*Sadness, emptiness or feeling down
    Hopelessness</P> 
    <P>*Tiredness and lack of energy</P>
    <P>*Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling incapable</P>
    <P>*Trouble concentrating and trouble making decisions</P>
     <P>*Irritability or excessive anger
    Decreased activity, effectiveness and productivity</P>
     <P>*Avoidance of social activities</P>
     <P>*Feelings of guilt and worries over the past</P>
     <P>*Poor appetite or overeating
    Sleep problems</P>

<P>In children, symptoms of persistent depressive disorder may include depressed mood and irritability.</P>
    
        
        <p>  * Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood</p>
        <p> *Feelings of hopelessness, or pessimism</p>

    <H3>PERIPARTUM(POSTPARTUM)DEPRESSION</H3>
<P>Depression During Pregnancy and after Childbirth

For most women, having a baby is a very exciting, joyous, and often anxious time. But for women with postpartum, or peripartum, depression it can become very distressing and difficult. Postpartum depression is a serious, but treatable medical illness involving feelings of extreme sadness, indifference and/or anxiety, as well as changes in energy, sleep, and appetite. It carries risks for the mother and child.

<H3>PREMENSTRUAL DYSPHORIC DISORDER</H3>
<P> Symptoms

Premenstrual syndrome is a set of physical and psychological symptoms that start about 7 to 10 days before a woman gets her monthly period (menstruation). Many women experience breast tenderness and abdominal pain. Other symptoms include headaches, back pain and joint or muscle ache. They may also have water retention (bloating) and sleeping problems or digestive problems.

Women who have PMS often feel exhausted, down, irritable and have lower self-esteem in the days leading up to their period. Some might feel like they are losing control over their body and emotions. But sometimes women report that they experience positive changes in the days before menstruation, like having more energy and finding it easier to get things done.

 <H3>SITUATIONAL DEPRESSION</H3><P>Situational depression is a short-term form of depression that can occur in the aftermath of various traumatic changes in your normal life, including divorce, retirement, loss of a job and the death of a relative or close friend. Doctors sometimes refer to the condition as adjustment disorder.
